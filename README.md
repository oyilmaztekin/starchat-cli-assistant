## StarChat - Your Local Coding Assistant ðŸŒŸ

This project harnesses the power of the StarChat Beta text generation model to serve as a helpful coding assistant. StarChat Beta is an advanced AI model designed to assist with coding tasks. To learn more about StarChat Beta, visit [HuggingFace's StarChat Beta](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/starchat-beta).

### Why Longchain Instead of Pipeline?

Unlike traditional approaches that involve downloading and using specific models, this project leverages a Longchain architecture. It seamlessly accesses Hugging Face's free models for text generation without the need for downloading any models to your computer. This allows for efficient and hassle-free text generation with the assistance of StarChat Beta.

Get started with your coding assistant and enjoy productive coding sessions! âœ¨
